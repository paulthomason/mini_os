# Mini OS

This repository contains a simple menu-based interface for a Raspberry Pi with an ST7735-based LCD display.

## Running as a `systemd` Service

1. Copy `mini_os.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/` (or `~/.config/systemd/user/` for a user service).
2. Adjust the paths in the unit file if you place the project somewhere other than `/opt/mini_os`.
3. Reload systemd and enable the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable mini_os.service
   sudo systemctl start mini_os.service
   ```

The service definition will start the program on boot and restart it automatically if it exits unexpectedly.
